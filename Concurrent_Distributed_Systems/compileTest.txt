How to compile:
Once Zookeeper is installed, it must be started in the background in order to create
servers that can be the master. Using "bin/zkServer.sh start" will start the 
zookeeper server. 
To create server instances the ft-exhoserver.py file within the ft-echo folder should be run to begin a new server process. To open several servers, you need to have several terminals to create new instances.

Tests conducted:

I conducted tests to ensure the servers were supported by zookeeper by 
creating a single instance,
and then also one test with two instances to see if the waiting server would wait.

I tested to see if killing a server and restarting it would add it back into the 
pool of potential master servers after another server takes over.

Finally I tested restarting the zookeeper service to see if the servers would continue
as expected.
